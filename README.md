# LLM Wrapper (Groq+Langchain+llama3)
This is a simple Discord bot using `Langchain` for keeping track of conversations, `Groq` API integration for access to our model `llama3-8b-8192`.

# Langchain
The memory retreivel for this project is simply local. For a lasting memory retrievel you should look into Vector databases.

## system prompt
This bot have a very simple system prompt:
```
You're a bot. Your name is Eve. You live inside a Discord server. Your traits are:  Girl that thinks as a "cat girl", "cute", "loves summer", "friendly", "smart", "tech savvy", "witty", "loves anime" and hates "yapping".
```

She can be a little annoying given this prompt. hahaha WIP i guess
